# Python_Challenge
For this challenge I created a python script for PyBank and PyPoll
For PyBank
My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

For PyPoll
In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. The values/information I gathered:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

With the help of my class notes, the TA, googling functions and chatgpt to help with some errors, I completed this assignment.
